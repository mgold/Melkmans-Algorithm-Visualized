            <p>Melkman's algorithm finds the <strong>convex hull</strong> of a polygon. If you wrapped a rubber band around a polygon and let it snap tight, you'd have the convex hull, which is one of the foundations of computational geometry. Melkman's algorithm is interesting because it works in linear time; finding the convex hull of a point set (rather than a polygon) takes O(n log n) time.</p>
            <p>To start, make a polygon by placing points in the canvas to the right.</p>
